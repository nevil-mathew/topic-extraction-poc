## Why TriTopic?

Most topic models rely on a single signal -- either word co-occurrences (LDA, NMF) or embeddings alone (BERTopic). This limits their ability to separate topics that share vocabulary but differ semantically, or vice versa.

TriTopic solves this by **fusing three complementary views** of the document corpus into a single graph:

1. **Semantic view** -- sentence-transformer embeddings capture meaning
2. **Lexical view** -- TF-IDF similarity captures surface-level word patterns
3. **Metadata view** -- optional categorical/numerical features add domain context

On top of this multi-view graph, TriTopic applies **consensus Leiden clustering** (multiple runs aggregated via co-occurrence matrices) and **iterative refinement** (embeddings are pulled toward cluster centroids and re-clustered). The result: topics that are more accurate, more coherent, more stable, and assign every document (zero outliers by default).

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-view graph fusion** | Combines semantic embeddings, TF-IDF lexical similarity, and optional metadata into a single graph, avoiding the "embedding blur" that single-view models suffer from |
| **Mutual kNN + SNN graphs** | Eliminates noise bridges between unrelated documents using bidirectional neighbor checks and shared-neighbor weighting |
| **Consensus Leiden clustering** | Runs the Leiden algorithm multiple times and merges results via a co-occurrence matrix, producing dramatically more stable topics than single-run approaches |
| **Iterative refinement** | Alternates between clustering and embedding refinement, pulling documents toward their topic centroids to sharpen boundaries |
| **Bidirectional resolution search** | Automatically finds the Leiden resolution parameter that produces the target number of topics |
| **Dimensionality reduction** | Reduces high-dimensional embeddings (384-768d) to ~10d with UMAP or PaCMAP before graph construction, improving neighbor quality |
| **100% corpus coverage** | Zero outliers by default -- every document is assigned to a topic, unlike HDBSCAN-based approaches |
| **Soft topic assignments** | Computes per-document probability distributions over all topics, not just hard labels |
| **Post-fit outlier reduction** | Reassigns outlier documents using centroid similarity or neighbor voting after the model is fitted |
| **Hierarchical topic merging** | Iteratively merges the most similar topic pairs to reach a target count, or manually merges specific topics |
| **Multiple keyword methods** | c-TF-IDF, BM25, and KeyBERT keyword extraction with automatic diversity |
| **LLM-powered labels** | Generates human-readable topic names via Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini |
| **Interactive visualizations** | 2D and 3D document maps, keyword bar charts, dendrograms, similarity heatmaps, and temporal topic evolution via Plotly |
| **TensorFlow Projector export** | Export embeddings and topic metadata for [projector.tensorflow.org](https://projector.tensorflow.org) with one call |
| **scikit-learn compatible** | Familiar `fit()` / `transform()` / `fit_transform()` API |
| **Save and load** | Full model persistence including fitted reducer, probabilities, and graph state |

**Step 1 - Embeddings:** Documents are encoded into dense vectors using a sentence-transformer model (local) or a cloud embedding API (e.g. Google Gemini). Pre-computed embeddings can also be passed directly.

**Step 1.5 - Dimensionality reduction:** High-dimensional embeddings (384-768d) are projected to ~10 dimensions using UMAP or PaCMAP. This dramatically improves kNN neighbor quality and speeds up graph construction. Full-dimensional embeddings are kept for centroid computation and keyword extraction.

**Step 2 - Lexical matrix:** TF-IDF with n-grams captures surface-level word patterns that embeddings may miss.

**Step 3 - Metadata graph (optional):** Categorical and numerical metadata fields create additional edges between related documents.

**Step 4 - Multi-view graph fusion:** The semantic kNN graph (built on reduced embeddings), lexical graph, and metadata graph are combined with configurable weights into a single igraph Graph. The semantic graph can use mutual kNN, SNN, or a hybrid of both.

**Step 5 - Consensus Leiden clustering:** The Leiden algorithm runs multiple times (default: 10) with different seeds. A sparse co-occurrence matrix records how often each pair of documents lands in the same cluster. The default `consensus_method="graph"` then thresholds this matrix and runs Leiden once more on the resulting weighted graph to produce the consensus partition (Lancichinetti & Fortunato, *Consensus clustering in complex networks*, Sci. Rep. 2:336, 2012). This is far more memory-efficient than the legacy hierarchical-linkage approach and avoids the N×N memory wall entirely. Clusters below `min_cluster_size` are marked as outliers (-1).

**Step 6 - Iterative refinement:** Embeddings are softly blended toward their topic centroid (20% pull), then the graph and clustering are re-run. This loop continues until the Adjusted Rand Index between consecutive iterations exceeds the convergence threshold (default: 0.95), or until `max_iterations` is reached. During iterative refinement, the dimensionality reducer transforms the refined embeddings for each new graph-building pass.

**Step 7 - Keywords and centroids:** c-TF-IDF (or BM25/KeyBERT) extracts representative keywords per topic. Topic centroids are computed as the mean embedding of each topic's documents. Soft probabilities are computed via cosine similarity to centroids passed through softmax.

**Quick overrides** without creating a config object:

```python
model = TriTopic(

    n_neighbors=20,
    use_iterative_refinement=True,
    verbose=True,
    random_state=42,
)
```

You can also modify the config after construction:

```python
model = TriTopic()
model.config.use_dim_reduction = False       # disable dim reduction
model.config.graph_type = "snn"              # use pure SNN graph
model.config.keyword_method = "bm25"         # switch keyword method
```

## Memory Optimization for Large Datasets

TriTopic handles **100,000+ documents on a laptop** out of the box. This section explains why, and what knobs to reach for if you ever hit a wall.

### The original problem (before 2.3.0)

To find stable topics, TriTopic runs Leiden clustering 10 times and then asks: *"How often did each pair of documents end up in the same cluster?"* This pairwise tally is a **co-occurrence matrix** of size N × N.

Older versions densified that matrix and ran hierarchical clustering (`scipy.linkage`) on it. Both steps scale as N²:

| Documents (N) | N × N cells | Old peak memory |
|---|---|---|
| 5,000 | 25 M | ~0.6 GB |
| 20,000 | 400 M | ~10 GB |
| 50,000 | 2.5 B | **~60 GB** (OOM on most machines) |
| 100,000 | 10 B | **~240 GB** (will not fit anywhere) |

### The 2.3.0 default: graph consensus

The new default `consensus_method="graph"` (Lancichinetti & Fortunato, *Consensus clustering in complex networks*, Sci. Rep. 2:336, 2012) replaces the dense matrix **and** the `scipy.linkage` step with a single Leiden pass on a thresholded sparse co-occurrence **graph**:

1. Keep only document pairs that co-cluster in at least `consensus_threshold_tau` (default **0.5**, i.e. 5 out of 10 runs) of the Leiden runs.
2. Build a weighted graph from those surviving pairs (typically <1% of N²).
3. Run Leiden once on that graph — that is your consensus partition.

| Documents (N) | Old (hierarchical) | New (graph, default) |
|---|---|---|
| 20,000 | ~10 GB | **~0.3 GB** |
| 50,000 | ~60 GB | **~0.8 GB** |
| 100,000 | ~240 GB | **~2 GB** |

Quality is at least as good — the LF paper shows graph consensus improves stability and accuracy versus any single Leiden run. You do not need to do anything: the new default is on automatically.

### When to touch the knobs

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| Any size, default install | **Nothing.** The 2.3.0 default is already memory-safe. |
| You want stricter / looser consensus | Tune `consensus_threshold_tau` in `[0.3, 0.8]`. Higher τ = stricter (fewer, tighter topics). |
| You want bit-for-bit identical results to TriTopic 2.2.x | Set `consensus_method="hierarchical"`. See below. |
| You hit an OOM crash | Make sure you are on 2.3.0+ and using `consensus_method="graph"` (default). |

### Tuning the consensus threshold τ

```python
config = TriTopicConfig(
    consensus_method="graph",          # default
    consensus_threshold_tau=0.5,       # default
)
```

- **τ = 0.3** — loose. More edges survive, larger / merged topics, more robust to noisy Leiden runs.
- **τ = 0.5** — balanced. Recommended starting point.
- **τ = 0.7** — strict. Only pairs that almost-always co-clustered survive; produces tighter, more conservative topics.

The LF paper reports results are robust across `τ ∈ [0.3, 0.8]`, so this is a soft dial, not a cliff.

### Legacy hierarchical mode (opt-in)

The old hierarchical-linkage path is still available for backwards compatibility:

```python
config = TriTopicConfig(
    consensus_method="hierarchical",   # legacy
    low_memory=True,                   # use sparse co-occurrence (still N² in the worst case)
)
```

For best results in legacy mode, install the `legacy-consensus` extra — it adds `fastcluster`, a C++ replacement for `scipy.linkage` that is ~2-5× faster and avoids a hidden float64 copy:

```bash
pip install tritopic[legacy-consensus]
```

### What does `low_memory=True` still do?

In **graph mode** (default), `low_memory` only affects internal dtype choices and lexical-graph caching — the big win is already free.

In **hierarchical mode**, `low_memory=True` keeps the co-occurrence sparse and builds the condensed distance vector directly from it, saving ~7-20× on peak RAM versus the dense path. Same math, same topics, same `random_state`.

### Still want more headroom?

Independent of consensus method, these knobs trade a little quality for memory:

```python
config = TriTopicConfig(
    max_iterations=2,            # was 5. Refinement gains are mostly in rounds 1-2.
    n_consensus_runs=5,          # was 10. Slightly less stable, ~1% NMI drop.
    convergence_threshold=0.90,  # was 0.95. Stops one iteration sooner.
)
```

Combined, these typically give an additional 2-3× headroom with under 2% quality loss.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Spectral initialisation failed! ... Falling back to random initialisation!"

You may see this `UserWarning` from UMAP during fitting:

```
UserWarning: Spectral initialisation failed! The eigenvector solver failed.
This is likely due to too small an eigengap.
Consider adding some noise or jitter to your data.
Falling back to random initialisation!
```

**What it means (plain English):** UMAP -- the tool that shrinks your high-dimensional embeddings to ~10 dimensions -- normally starts by computing a smart initial placement using linear algebra ("spectral initialisation"). That math is unstable when your documents are very tightly packed or have lots of near-duplicates. When it fails, UMAP automatically falls back to placing points randomly and then optimizing from there.

**Does it affect my topics?** No. The fallback (random init + UMAP optimization) converges to essentially the same embedding. Your clustering quality is unaffected. The warning is informational, not an error.

**Is reproducibility affected?** No, as long as you set `random_state` in your config. Same seed, same output.

**Can I silence the warning?**

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(
    "ignore",
    message="Spectral initialisation failed",
)
```

**Common causes (none are bugs):**
- Many near-duplicate documents in the corpus
- Very tightly clustered embeddings (a corpus on one narrow topic)
- Very small datasets where the graph is fully connected

You can ignore the warning and use the resulting model normally.

### Other common issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Crash at `Iteration 1...` with no traceback | Out of memory in consensus step | Set `low_memory=True` (see [section above](#memory-optimization-for-large-datasets)) |
| `ImportError: cannot import name '...' from 'transformers'` in Colab | Colab silently upgraded torch/transformers mid-session | **Runtime -> Restart session**, then rerun |
| Too many tiny topics | `resolution` too high or `min_cluster_size` too low | Lower `resolution` (e.g. 0.8) or raise `min_cluster_size` |
| Too few large topics | `resolution` too low | Raise `resolution` (e.g. 1.3) or set `n_topics_target=N` |
| 30%+ outliers | HDBSCAN-like over-pruning of small clusters | Call `model.reduce_outliers(strategy="embeddings")` after fit |
| LLM labels are empty / generic | API call failed silently in earlier versions | v2.3.0+ retries with backoff; check API key and rate limits |

## Dimensionality Reduction

kNN graphs built on high-dimensional embeddings (384-768d) suffer from the curse of dimensionality: distances concentrate and neighbor quality degrades. TriTopic addresses this by reducing embeddings to a low-dimensional space before graph construction.

```python
model = TriTopic()
model.config.use_dim_reduction = True        # enabled by default
model.config.reduced_dims = 10               # target dimensions
model.config.dim_reduction_method = "umap"   # or "pacmap"
model.config.umap_n_neighbors = 15
model.config.umap_min_dist = 0.0             # 0.0 is best for clustering

model.fit(documents)

# Reduced embeddings are stored alongside full embeddings
print(model.reduced_embeddings_.shape)  # (n_docs, 10)
print(model.embeddings_.shape)          # (n_docs, 384)  full embeddings kept
```

**How it works:**

- Reduced embeddings are used only for graph construction (kNN neighbor search)
- Full-dimensional embeddings are used for centroid computation, keyword extraction, representative docs, and similarity calculations
- During iterative refinement, refined embeddings are re-projected through the fitted reducer at each iteration
- The fitted reducer is saved with `model.save()` so `transform()` on new documents works correctly

**When to disable it:**

```python
model.config.use_dim_reduction = False
```

Disable if your embeddings are already low-dimensional, or if you want to experiment with raw high-dimensional graph construction.

## Soft Topic Assignments

Every document gets a probability distribution over all topics, not just a hard label.

### Training documents

After `fit()`, probabilities are automatically available:

```python
model.fit(documents)

# Shape: (n_documents, n_topics)
print(model.probabilities_.shape)

# Each row sums to ~1.0
print(model.probabilities_[0].sum())  # ~1.0

# Probability distribution for document 0
for i, prob in enumerate(model.probabilities_[0]):
    topic_id = [t.topic_id for t in model.topics_ if t.topic_id != -1][i]
    print(f"  Topic {topic_id}: {prob:.3f}")
```

### New documents

```python
proba = model.transform_proba(["A new document about space exploration"])
# Shape: (1, n_topics)
print(proba)
```

**How it works:** Cosine similarity between document embeddings and topic centroid embeddings, followed by softmax normalization. Probabilities are recomputed automatically after any post-fit operation (outlier reduction, topic merging).

---

## Outlier Reduction

Leiden clustering combined with small-cluster removal can produce 20-40% outliers. `reduce_outliers()` reassigns them post-fit.

### Strategy: embeddings (default)

Each outlier is assigned to the topic whose centroid is most similar, if the similarity exceeds a threshold:

```python
model.fit(documents)
print(f"Outliers before: {(model.labels_ == -1).sum()}")

# Default threshold = config.outlier_threshold (0.1)
model.reduce_outliers(strategy="embeddings")
print(f"Outliers after: {(model.labels_ == -1).sum()}")

# Lower threshold = more aggressive reassignment
model.reduce_outliers(strategy="embeddings", threshold=0.05)
```

### Strategy: neighbors

Each outlier is assigned by majority vote of its k nearest non-outlier neighbors:

```python
model.reduce_outliers(strategy="neighbors")
```

This strategy is threshold-free and works well when outliers are near cluster boundaries.

**After reassignment:** Keywords, centroids, topic sizes, and probabilities are all recomputed automatically.

---

## Topic Merging

### Automatic: reduce to a target count

`reduce_topics()` iteratively merges the two most cosine-similar topic centroids until the target count is reached:

```python
model.fit(documents)
print(f"Topics found: {len([t for t in model.topics_ if t.topic_id != -1])}")

# Reduce to exactly 5 topics
model.reduce_topics(5)
print(f"Topics after: {len([t for t in model.topics_ if t.topic_id != -1])}")
```

At each step, the two most similar centroids are found, and the smaller topic is relabeled to the larger one. After all merges complete, keywords and centroids are re-extracted from scratch.

### Manual: merge specific topics

```python
# Merge topics 2 and 7 into one (the larger one's ID is kept)
model.merge_topics([2, 7])

# Merge three topics together
model.merge_topics([1, 4, 9])
```

This is useful when you inspect topics and find two that clearly cover the same theme.

---

## Keyword Extraction

TriTopic supports three keyword extraction methods:

### c-TF-IDF (default)

Class-based TF-IDF treats all documents in a topic as a single "class document" and scores terms by their distinctiveness for that topic compared to the corpus. This is the same approach used by BERTopic.

```python
model.config.keyword_method = "ctfidf"
```

### BM25

BM25 scoring is more robust to document length variations than TF-IDF:

```python
model.config.keyword_method = "bm25"
```

### KeyBERT

Embedding-based extraction that finds keywords by comparing candidate n-gram embeddings to the topic embedding. Uses Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) for diversity:

```python
model.config.keyword_method = "keybert"
```

### Accessing keywords

```python
# DataFrame view
df = model.get_topic_info()
print(df[["Topic", "Size", "Keywords"]])

# Detailed access for a specific topic
topic = model.get_topic(0)
print(topic.keywords)         # ['machine', 'learning', 'neural', ...]
print(topic.keyword_scores)   # [0.42, 0.38, 0.31, ...]

# Representative documents
docs = model.get_representative_docs(0, n_docs=3)
for idx, text in docs:
    print(f"  Doc {idx}: {text[:100]}...")
```

---

## LLM-Powered Labels

Generate human-readable topic names using Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini.

### With Claude (Anthropic)

```python
from tritopic import TriTopic, LLMLabeler

model = TriTopic()
model.fit(documents)

labeler = LLMLabeler(
    provider="anthropic",
    api_key="sk-ant-...",
    model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",  # fast and cheap
    language="english",                  # output language
    domain_hint="technology news",       # optional domain context
)
model.generate_labels(labeler)

# Topics now have labels and descriptions
df = model.get_topic_info()
print(df[["Topic", "Label", "Description"]])
```

### With GPT-4 (OpenAI)

```python
labeler = LLMLabeler(
    provider="openai",
    api_key="sk-...",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    language="german",          # works in any language
)
model.generate_labels(labeler)
```

### With Gemini (Google)

```python
labeler = LLMLabeler(
    provider="google",
    api_key="...",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",   # default if model omitted
)
model.generate_labels(labeler)
```

Install the required extra: `pip install tritopic[llm]` (includes all three providers).

### Controlling prompt size

By default each LLM call receives up to **5 representative documents**, each truncated to **500 characters**. Both limits are configurable:

```python
labeler = LLMLabeler(
    provider="anthropic",
    api_key="...",
    n_docs=3,           # fewer docs → lower cost / latency
    doc_max_chars=200,  # shorter snippets
)

# Higher quality: more context per topic
labeler = LLMLabeler(
    provider="anthropic",
    api_key="...",
    n_docs=8,
    doc_max_chars=1000,
)
```

> **Note:** `n_docs` draws from the representative documents stored at fit time, which are the docs closest to the topic centroid. If you set `n_docs` higher than `TriTopicConfig.n_representative_docs` (default 5), raise that value too:
>
> ```python
> from tritopic import TriTopic, TriTopicConfig
> config = TriTopicConfig(n_representative_docs=10)
> model = TriTopic(config=config)
> model.fit(documents)
>
> labeler = LLMLabeler(provider="anthropic", api_key="...", n_docs=8)
> model.generate_labels(labeler)
> ```

### Simple labeler (no API needed)

```python
from tritopic import SimpleLabeler

labeler = SimpleLabeler(n_words=3)
model.generate_labels(labeler)
# Labels like "Machine & Learning & Neural"
```

### Label specific topics only

```python
model.generate_labels(labeler, topics=[0, 3, 5])
```

If the LLM API call fails, the labeler automatically falls back to a keyword-based label (with exponential-backoff retry before giving up).

---

## Visualizations

All visualizations return interactive Plotly figures.

### Document map (2D)

2D scatter plot where each point is a document, colored by topic:

```python
fig = model.visualize(method="umap", show_outliers=True)
fig.show()
fig.write_html("document_map.html")
```

### Document map (3D)

Fully interactive 3D scatter — rotate, zoom, and hover for topic labels and document snippets:

```python
fig = model.visualize_3d()          # UMAP 3D (default)
fig = model.visualize_3d(method="pacmap")
fig = model.visualize_3d(show_outliers=False)
fig.show()
fig.write_html("document_map_3d.html")
```

### TensorFlow Embedding Projector export

Export to [projector.tensorflow.org](https://projector.tensorflow.org) for interactive PCA / UMAP / t-SNE exploration in the browser, with topics visible as color labels:

```python
# Recommended: export raw embeddings so the projector can apply its own reduction
vectors_path, metadata_path = model.export_projector("projector_export")

# Or export pre-reduced coordinates directly
vectors_path, metadata_path = model.export_projector("projector_export", embeddings="2d")
vectors_path, metadata_path = model.export_projector("projector_export", embeddings="3d")
```

This writes two TSV files:

- `vectors.tsv` — one document per row, tab-separated floats
- `metadata.tsv` — `topic_id`, `topic_label`, top-5 `keywords`, and a 150-character document snippet per row

**To load in the projector:**
1. Go to [projector.tensorflow.org](https://projector.tensorflow.org) and click **Load**
2. Upload `vectors.tsv` as the tensor file
3. Upload `metadata.tsv` as the metadata file
4. Use **Color by → topic_label** to colour points by topic

The `embeddings` parameter accepts:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `"original"` (default) | Raw embeddings — lets the projector apply PCA/UMAP/t-SNE interactively |
| `"reduced"` | Clustering-space reduced embeddings (`reduced_embeddings_`) |
| `"2d"` | Fresh UMAP/PaCMAP projection to 2D |
| `"3d"` | Fresh UMAP/PaCMAP projection to 3D |

### Topic keywords

Horizontal bar charts showing the top keywords and their scores for each topic:

```python
fig = model.visualize_topics(n_keywords=8)
fig.show()
```

### Topic hierarchy

Dendrogram showing how topics relate to each other based on centroid distances:

```python
fig = model.visualize_hierarchy()
fig.show()
```

### Topic similarity heatmap

Cosine similarity matrix between all topic centroids:

```python
from tritopic import TopicVisualizer

viz = TopicVisualizer()
fig = viz.plot_topic_similarity(model.topic_embeddings_, model.topics_)
fig.show()
```

### Topics over time

Stacked area chart showing topic prevalence over time (requires timestamps):

```python
from tritopic import TopicVisualizer

viz = TopicVisualizer()
fig = viz.plot_topic_over_time(
    labels=model.labels_,
    timestamps=your_timestamps,   # list of datetime-like values
    topics=model.topics_,
)
fig.show()
```

---

## Evaluation

```python
metrics = model.evaluate()
```

Returns a dictionary with:

| Metric | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `coherence_mean` | -1 to 1 | Average NPMI coherence across topics (higher = more coherent keywords) |
| `coherence_std` | 0+ | Standard deviation of coherence across topics |
| `diversity` | 0 to 1 | Proportion of unique keywords across all topics (higher = more distinct topics) |
| `stability` | -1 to 1 | Average pairwise ARI across consensus runs (higher = more reproducible) |
| `n_topics` | 1+ | Number of non-outlier topics |
| `outlier_ratio` | 0 to 1 | Fraction of documents labeled as outliers |

Additional metrics are available as standalone functions:

```python
from tritopic.utils.metrics import (
    compute_coherence,
    compute_diversity,
    compute_stability,
    compute_silhouette,
    compute_downstream_score,
)

# Silhouette score for cluster separation
sil = compute_silhouette(model.embeddings_, model.labels_)

# Downstream classification performance
f1 = compute_downstream_score(
    model.embeddings_, model.labels_, true_labels, task="classification"
)
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Pre-computed embeddings

Skip the embedding step by passing your own vectors:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

encoder = SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5")
embeddings = encoder.encode(documents)

model = TriTopic()
model.fit(documents, embeddings=embeddings)
```

### Multi-model embeddings

Combine embeddings from multiple models for richer representations:

```python
from tritopic import EmbeddingEngine
from tritopic.core.embeddings import MultiModelEmbedding

multi = MultiModelEmbedding(
    model_names=["all-MiniLM-L6-v2", "all-mpnet-base-v2"],
    weights=[0.5, 0.5],
)
embeddings = multi.encode(documents)

model = TriTopic()
model.fit(documents, embeddings=embeddings)
```

### Metadata-enhanced topics

Documents with shared metadata (source, category, date) get additional graph edges:

```python
import pandas as pd

metadata = pd.DataFrame({
    "source": ["twitter", "news", "twitter", ...],
    "category": ["tech", "science", "tech", ...],
})

model = TriTopic()
model.config.use_metadata_view = True
model.config.metadata_weight = 0.2

model.fit(documents, metadata=metadata)
```

Categorical columns create edges between documents with matching values. Numerical columns create edges between documents with similar values (similarity > 0.8 after normalization).

### Target number of topics

Use `n_topics_target` to automatically find the Leiden resolution that produces a specific number of topics:

```python
model = TriTopic(n_topics_target=10)
model.fit(documents)
# TriTopic uses bidirectional resolution search to find ~10 topics
```

### Finding the optimal resolution

The resolution parameter controls how many topics Leiden produces. You can search for the best value:

```python
from tritopic.core.clustering import ConsensusLeiden

# After initial fit
clusterer = ConsensusLeiden()
optimal = clusterer.find_optimal_resolution(
    graph=model.graph_,
    resolution_range=(0.5, 2.0),
    n_steps=10,
    target_n_topics=15,       # optional: aim for ~15 topics
)
print(f"Optimal resolution: {optimal}")

# Re-fit with the optimal resolution
model.config.resolution = optimal
model.fit(documents)
```

### Disabling features

```python
# No iterative refinement (faster, less accurate)
model = TriTopic(use_iterative_refinement=False)

# No dimensionality reduction
model.config.use_dim_reduction = False

# No lexical view (embeddings only)
model.config.use_lexical_view = False
```

### Complete workflow

```python
from tritopic import TriTopic, TriTopicConfig, LLMLabeler

# 1. Configure
config = TriTopicConfig(
    embedding_model="all-mpnet-base-v2",
    n_neighbors=20,
    graph_type="hybrid",
    use_dim_reduction=True,
    reduced_dims=10,
    n_consensus_runs=15,
    use_iterative_refinement=True,
    max_iterations=7,
    convergence_threshold=0.97,
    keyword_method="ctfidf",
    n_keywords=15,
)

# 2. Fit
model = TriTopic(config=config)
model.fit(documents)

# 3. Reduce outliers
model.reduce_outliers(strategy="embeddings", threshold=0.05)

# 4. Merge to desired granularity
model.reduce_topics(10)

# 5. Label with LLM
labeler = LLMLabeler(provider="anthropic", api_key="...")
model.generate_labels(labeler)

# 6. Evaluate
metrics = model.evaluate()

# 7. Explore
print(model.get_topic_info())
print(f"Probabilities shape: {model.probabilities_.shape}")

fig = model.visualize()
fig.show()

# 8. Save
model.save("production_model.pkl")
```

## Architecture

### Graph types

**kNN:** Each document connects to its k nearest neighbors. Simple but includes asymmetric "one-way" connections that can bridge unrelated clusters.

**Mutual kNN:** Only keeps edges where both nodes are in each other's neighborhoods. This removes noise bridges and produces cleaner clusters.

**SNN (Shared Nearest Neighbors):** Edge weight equals the number of shared neighbors between two nodes, normalized by k. This captures structural similarity and is robust against noise.

**Hybrid (default):** Weighted combination of mutual kNN and SNN: `(1 - snn_weight) * mutual_kNN + snn_weight * SNN`. Gives both direct similarity (mutual kNN) and structural similarity (SNN).

### Consensus clustering

Running Leiden once is sensitive to random initialization. TriTopic runs it `n_consensus_runs` times (default: 10) with different seeds and builds a co-occurrence matrix recording how often each document pair was assigned to the same cluster. Hierarchical clustering (average linkage) on this matrix produces the final partition, selected by maximizing the average ARI with all individual runs. The stability score (average pairwise ARI across runs) quantifies how reproducible the clustering is.

### Iterative refinement

After an initial clustering pass, document embeddings are softly blended toward their topic centroid: `refined = 0.8 * original + 0.2 * centroid`, then L2-normalized. The full pipeline (graph + clustering) re-runs on the refined embeddings. This process converges when consecutive partitions have ARI >= 0.95 (configurable). The effect is tighter, more separated topic clusters.

### Supported embedding models

#### Local models (sentence-transformers)

Any model from the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library works. Recommended choices:

| Model | Dimensions | Speed | Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | Fast | Good | Default. Best speed/quality tradeoff. |
| `all-mpnet-base-v2` | 768 | Medium | Better | Higher quality, 2x slower. |
| `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` | 768 | Medium | Best | State-of-the-art for English. |
| `BAAI/bge-m3` | 1024 | Slow | Best | Multilingual support. |
| `hkunlp/instructor-large` | 768 | Slow | Best | Task-specific with instructions. |

#### API-based embedding (Google Gemini)

To use Google Gemini embeddings instead of a local model, set `embedding_provider="google"`.
Requires: `pip install 'tritopic[llm]'`

```python
from tritopic import TriTopic, TriTopicConfig

config = TriTopicConfig(
    embedding_provider="google",
    embedding_api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY",
    # Optional tuning:
    embedding_output_dim=768,        # Matryoshka compression (128–3072); default 768
    embedding_api_batch_size=100,    # docs per request (max 250)
    embedding_batch_delay=4.0,       # set ~4.0 on Gemini free tier (5–15 RPM)
)
model = TriTopic(config=config)
model.fit(documents)
```

**Supported Gemini models:**

| Model | Default dims | MRL range | task_type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-embedding-2` | 768* | 128–3072 | via prompt prefix | Default. Best quality, 8192 tok/text. |
| `gemini-embedding-001` | 768 | — | ✅ (`CLUSTERING` etc.) | Stable, 2048 tok/text. |

\* `gemini-embedding-2` output defaults to 768 dims (Matryoshka truncation). Pass `embedding_output_dim=3072` for full resolution — same API cost, higher memory.

**With `gemini-embedding-2` (default, best quality):**
```python
config = TriTopicConfig(
    embedding_provider="google",
    embedding_api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY",
    embedding_model="gemini-embedding-2",    # explicit; also the default
    embedding_output_dim=768,                # Matryoshka default (pass 3072 for full resolution)
    embedding_api_batch_size=100,            # docs per request (max 250)
    embedding_batch_delay=4.0,               # ~4.0 for free tier; 0.0 for paid
)
model = TriTopic(config=config)
model.fit(documents)
```

**With `gemini-embedding-001` (stable, supports task_type):**
```python
config = TriTopicConfig(
    embedding_provider="google",
    embedding_api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY",
    embedding_model="gemini-embedding-001",
    embedding_task_type="CLUSTERING",        # optimises embeddings for topic modeling
)
model = TriTopic(config=config)
model.fit(documents)
```

For `gemini-embedding-2`, `embedding_task_type` is automatically applied as a prompt prefix (the model does not accept it as an API parameter).

## Benchmarks

Evaluated on four standard text classification datasets against BERTopic, LDA (scikit-learn), and NMF (scikit-learn). Each configuration was run with 3 random seeds across multiple topic counts (k). Metrics: NMI against ground-truth labels, NPMI coherence, and coverage (1 - outlier fraction).

### Overall Results

| Model | Mean NMI | Mean Coherence (NPMI) | Mean Coverage | Wins (NMI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TriTopic** | **0.575** | **0.341** | **1.000** | **4/4 datasets** |
| BERTopic | 0.513 | 0.233 | 0.808 | 0/4 |
| NMF | 0.416 | 0.330 | 1.000 | 0/4 |
| LDA | 0.299 | 0.161 | 1.000 | 0/4 |

TriTopic achieves the **highest NMI on every single dataset** while maintaining 100% corpus coverage (zero outliers). BERTopic's HDBSCAN leaves 19.2% of documents unassigned on average.

### Per-Dataset NMI

| Dataset | Docs | k range | TriTopic | BERTopic | NMF | LDA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 Newsgroups | 2,000 | 10-50 | **0.532** | 0.519 | 0.319 | 0.158 |
| BBC News | 1,225 | 3-20 | **0.702** | 0.642 | 0.648 | 0.505 |
| AG News | 2,000 | 3-20 | **0.527** | 0.380 | 0.191 | 0.027 |
| Arxiv | 2,000 | 5-25 | **0.540** | 0.511 | 0.505 | 0.508 |

### Per-Dataset Coherence (NPMI)

| Dataset | TriTopic | BERTopic | NMF | LDA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 Newsgroups | **0.413** | 0.223 | 0.374 | 0.256 |
| BBC News | **0.380** | 0.082 | 0.336 | 0.154 |
| AG News | 0.269 | 0.161 | **0.325** | 0.092 |
| Arxiv | 0.303 | **0.466** | 0.277 | 0.150 |

### Methodology

- All embeddings: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
- BERTopic: default HDBSCAN settings with UMAP reduction
- NMF / LDA: scikit-learn implementations with TF-IDF input
- TriTopic: default settings (hybrid graph, consensus Leiden, iterative refinement)
- 3 random seeds per configuration, results averaged
